## Introduction

This project aims to analyze a diabetes dataset to identify patterns and build predictive models to determine the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical attributes. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and interpretability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains medical information about patients, including whether or not they have diabetes. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) where 1 indicates the patient has diabetes

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
3. **Model Building**: Develop predictive models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. **Model Interpretability**: Use SHAP to interpret model predictions and understand feature importance.
